Tool Libraries are the simple premise of a community having collective ownership of tools. The benefit herein, is that while tools are useful, they might only come in useful for some people a few times a year. Sure, everyone should have a screwdriver, but does everyone really need a table saw? Probably not, but I'm sure most people could have used one, or could have used the end product of using one, at least once just this year.

This is not a purely theory idea, this is extant, you may even have one in your town, tucked away in some small building that you didn't know about.
