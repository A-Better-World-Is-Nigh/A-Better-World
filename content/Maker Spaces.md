Maker Space are a place where things can be built inside of the community where they exist. They exist alongside, not in opposition, to other manufacturing apparatuses. There is a fair amount of overlap (we choose not to distinguish) between maker spaces, hacker spaces, and fab labs. 

Imagine needing a chair of a given dimension, some design ideas, and a few scraps of wood, you can go to a place in your neighborhood where they will build the product out for you for low cost. Maybe you want to build it out yourself. Either way, there should be people willing and able to help you.

Perhaps, they use some standardized parts to help build it out preprogrammed into their CNC. Maybe someone there is a clothier, someone specializes in furniture. The point is to end up with an internal resource to help everyone get what they need by working closely within their community. 

Some ideas for ways of approaching this minimal building process are visible in [How to Build Your Own Living Structures](http://www.publiccollectors.org/LivingStructuresk_isaacs-1.pdf).

This veers a little more into the concept of prefiguration than maker spaces traditionally inhabit. This asserts that maker spaces are community resources, we build them with the intent of *serving* and *being served* by our community.
